= Code FREKA Security

We utilize Linux containers based on Docker which allow a good logical isolation (separate process-set, resource-limits, …).
It should be very difficult to escape from the containers and do harm to the underlying host-system but we do not guarantee
that it is impossible. This is why we recommend to run a dedicated Docker daemon only for Code FREAK that does nothing
else except hosting the IDE instances and running untrusted code.
Additionally you should not run the Code FREAK application and its sidekick Docker daemon on the same host for similar
reasons: If someone manages to escape the IDE containers they could hijack the backend application and steal sensitive
information. Even if someone does not accomplishes to break out of the container they could spin up so many containers
that all host system resources are exhausted.
